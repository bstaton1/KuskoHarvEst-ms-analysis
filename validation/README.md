> This subdirectory houses the code and additional data needed to perform the harvest validation, which compares annual estimates of the in-season monitoring program compared to the post-season monitoring program, after adjusting the latter to be of comparable scale.

**NOTE**: the data contained in this subdirectory are owned by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) and are subject to post-facto review as part of normal data review and recovery operations. Please contact D. Koster ([david.koster\@alaska.gov](mailto:david.koster@alaska.gov)), [ADF&G Division of Subsistence](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=subsistence.main) with questions about data collection or updates.

The term ISMP refers to the in-season harvest monitoring program, and PSMP refers to the post-season monitoring program, which is operated by ADF&G, long-term, and assesses the actual annual harvest -- ISMP estimates are primarily useful for in-season use. This analysis adjusts the PSMP estimates -- which are comprehensive by community, year, and species -- to include only drift gillnets, fished between mid-June and mid-July, by residents of the 11 communities in the ISMP study area. In the code, PSMP estimates pre- and post-correction are `truth_pre_correct` and `truth`, respectively. It is assumed that if the ISMP estimates are similar to those in the `truth` data set, the ISMP has performed sufficiently to meet its purpose.

| `data/Calendar Data.csv`            | Contains aggregated ADF&G subsistence harvest calendar data from 2016-2022, provided by D. Koster. The number in each cell represents the total number of salmon reported harvested that day summed across all calendar-submitting households. Used to represent the timing of subsistence harvest for villages sampled by both the in-season and post-season programs.                       |
| `data/post-season-gear-comps.csv`   | Contains records of fishers reporting their primary harvest gear (drift gillnet, set gillnet, fishwheel, hook and line or dipnet) for the season. Used to calculate the fraction of PSMP harvest attributable to drift gillnets. *2022 data are unpublished but provided by D. Koster, the other years transcribed from PSMP reports referenced below.*                                       |
| `data/post-season-harvest-ests.csv` | Contains PSMP harvest estimates by community, year, and species. *2022 data are unpublished but provided by D. Koster, the other years transcribed from PSMP reports referenced below.*                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `prepare-calendar-data.R`           | Compiles the raw calendar data into usable format for analysis, summarized by spatial grouping (5 groups) rather than by community. Fills in a few rare cases with the average of other years. The principle object of use created by this script is the `calendars` data set, which contains the estimated daily cumulative harvest proportions by species and each community spatial group. |
| `prepare-truth.R`                   | Combines the uncorrected PSMP estimates with correction factors for gear type and time of season to calculate the `truth` data set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `validation-analysis.R`             | Combines the `truth` data set with the ISMP estimates (contained in the 'KuskoHarvData' package) for comparison/validation. Calculates errors by year, species, and area.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
