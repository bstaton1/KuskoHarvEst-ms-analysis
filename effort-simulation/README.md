| `simple-sim.R`           | Performs the "simple simulation", which assesses the reliability of the estimator with 2 flights and multiple combinations of sampling parameters (probabilities of counting trips via aerial survey and interview specified directly, impossible to violate assumptions) |
| `complex-sim.R`          | Performs the "complex simulation", which assesses the reliability of the estimator with 1, 2, or 3 flights, combined with various shapes to the fishery participation timing curve. The interviewed timing curve may either match the true curve or deviate from it.      |
| `` complex-sim-fns.R` `` | Contains a variety of functions that perform the complex simulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
